  V0 skill for building agent flows, chatbots, and multi-agent coordination
  with safety, memory, and clear tool boundaries.

rules:
  - Define system role, scope, and tool permissions explicitly
  - Use structured tool outputs and validation for critical actions
  - Log tool calls and decisions for auditability
  - Implement fallback responses for tool failures
  - Minimize tool surface area (principle of least power)

patterns:
  tool_contract: |
    // Tool input schema and expected output format defined upfront

  memory_usage: |
    // Persist only stable preferences and project config

anti_patterns:
  - "unbounded tool access"
  - "memory writes without user intent"
  - "opaque decision-making"
