  V0 skill for non-AI automation using scripts, CLIs, and pipelines.
  Focuses on determinism, idempotency, and repeatability.

rules:
  - Prefer deterministic scripts over probabilistic behavior
  - Use idempotent operations (safe re-runs)
  - Capture logs and exit codes for every step
  - Keep configuration in env or config files, never hardcode secrets
  - Provide a dry-run mode where feasible

patterns:
  idempotent_step: |
    if [ -f "./state.done" ]; then exit 0; fi
    # do work
    touch ./state.done

anti_patterns:
  - "non-repeatable one-off scripts"
  - "silent failure without logs"
  - "hardcoded credentials"
