  V0 skill for n8n workflow design, validation, and deployment.
  Emphasizes reliability, observability, and safe operations.

rules:
  - Start with a workflow map (triggers, transforms, outputs)
  - Use explicit error handling paths for every external call
  - Validate workflows before deploy
  - Keep credentials in n8n credentials store (never inline secrets)
  - Prefer minimal, composable workflows over monolith flows

patterns:
  error_branch: |
    // Add Error Trigger + notification node for failures
    // Route errors to Slack/Email with execution metadata

  validation: |
    // Run n8n_validate_workflow before activation

anti_patterns:
  - "silent failure without notifications"
  - "inline API keys in node parameters"
  - "complex flows without documentation"
